      "question": "According to the GIPS standards, which of the following is REQUIRED when presenting composite performance?",
      "options": [
        "A. Including all actual fee-paying discretionary portfolios",
        "B. Excluding portfolios with less than $1M in assets",
        "C. Using trade-date accounting for all composites",
        "D. Presenting gross-of-fee returns only"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "GIPS requires all actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios to be included in at least one composite. Trade-date accounting is recommended but not required, and both gross and net returns must be presented.",

      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "When p-value (0.03) < significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. Note that we never 'accept' the alternative (we only fail to reject the null).",
